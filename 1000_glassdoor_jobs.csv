You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.

What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own.

We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

Next has raised over $380 million from top tier investors and is the valley’s latest unicorn, valued at over $1 billion.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes – something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We’re here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

You’ll also have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team and will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.

Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production)

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners

Desired Skills and Experience:


2-4 years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning and/or statistical analysis

BS/MS in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively

Fluency with an analytical programming language (APL) (preferably Python) and the standard numerical packages

Fluency with data extraction/manipulation tools (preferably SQL & Pandas)

One of our core values is ‘Play as a Team’; this means making sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and make a difference. We win by playing together.

Data Scientist

Next Insurance is a fast-growing 300+ person startup based in Silicon Valley and is led by a team of experienced entrepreneurs with a history of successful outcomes. Our mission is to transform insurance for small businesses by combining world-class technology and phenomenal customer service to offer better insurance at a lower price. Next has raised over $380 million from top tier investors and is the valley’s latest unicorn, valued at over $1 billion.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes – something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We’re here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

We are looking for a driven Data Scientist to help us bring machine learning to the insurance industry. As a data scientist at Next Insurance, you will work on a wide range of projects, including building predictive risk models, fine-tuning user experience, and optimizing internal operations. You will enable us to make the best use of our proprietary data, supplemented with novel data sources which you get to assemble creatively.

You’ll also have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team and will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.

Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production)

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners

Desired Skills and Experience:


2-4 years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning and/or statistical analysis

BS/MS in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively

Fluency with an analytical programming language (APL) (preferably Python) and the standard numerical packages

Fluency with data extraction/manipulation tools (preferably SQL & Pandas)

One of our core values is ‘Play as a Team’; this means making sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and make a difference. We win by playing together. Next Insurance is an equal opportunity employer and prioritizes building a diverse and inclusive workplace. We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants of any type and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, genetic information or characteristic, gender identity and expression, veteran status, or other non-job-related characteristics or other prohibited grounds specified in applicable federal, state, and local laws.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

Data Scientist,-1,"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.
Clear, logical, and thorough in written and verbal communication

Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex needsbringing better care to where it's needed most, block by block. Founded in 2017 on the premise that ""health is local"" and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs along with some of the top healthcare investors in the country.

Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings.

In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.

Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.

Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To close gaps in care and advance equity in the communities we serve, we have to start with making our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bringing together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to ensure that every person on the Cityblock team, and every Cityblock member, feels supported and included as a part of our community.

Machine Learning Engineer,-1,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions. The key problem Sisu solves is to help identify what’s driving change among this enormous feature and hypothesis space. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.

As a machine learning engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the future of machine learning on massive, structured data.

Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.

About the Role:

The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:
Clinical - Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions? This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members? Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members? This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care? Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.
