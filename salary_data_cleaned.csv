An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

Inspiring the whole Mars business to adopt data driven decision-making by developing advanced analytics methods is huge in your role. How? By mining vast amounts of data from company databases for insights that will help solve business problems and ultimately make Mars more profitable.

Working in a small multidisciplinary team alongside the Global Analytics, Data Engineering, Business Translation and AI teams, you’ll partner with Product Owners to solve problems that real users face using advanced digital techniques. That also means closely collaborating with users from our segments and markets around the world to find the right problems to solve. More than that, you’ll use this direct user exposure to invent true ‘firsts’. That’s new and emerging approaches that Mars, and maybe even the industry, haven’t seen before.

A big part of your role will be choosing the most appropriate technique, based on business need and available data, to develop custom data models and algorithms. As part of that, you’ll also create processes and tools to monitor and analyze model performance and data accuracy. All the time, balancing time to deliver with level of detail and accuracy.

Working with different functional teams, you’ll implement your models and monitor their outcomes – making sure we’re conforming to data security standards at all times. Thinking about the newest technology, you’ll make sure we’re maximizing our efficiency and productivity and provide subject matter expertise across the business whenever it’s needed.

(Glassdoor Est.)","WHO WE LOOK FOR

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

You will be expected to run point on whole projects, end-to-end, and to mentor less experienced Data Engineers.

As you continue to execute successfully, we will build a customized development plan together that leads you through the engineering or management growth tracks.

Expectations

Required Travel - 30% travel to customer sites, conferences, and other related events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel has been temporarily restricted.

Customer Facing - You will interact with customers on a regular basis, sometimes daily, other times weekly/bi-weekly.
